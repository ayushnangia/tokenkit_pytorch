# Next Steps for tokenkit PyTorch Implementation

## Recent Improvements

1. **Added missing core components:**
   - Implemented `baseline_utils.py` with MinED mapping and KL divergence functions
   - Added missing loss functions (side path and mined mapping loss)
   - Implemented all utility scripts (`compute_tokenizer_info.py` and `compute_mined_mapping.py`)
   - Created unit tests for loss functions

## Remaining Work

### Testing
1. **Unit tests:**
   - Create tests for alignment algorithms in `align.py`
   - Implement tests for tokenizer handling
   - Add tests for the hypernetwork model

2. **Integration tests:**
   - End-to-end tests for cross-tokenizer distillation
   - End-to-end tests for zero-shot tokenizer transfer
   - Output comparison between JAX and PyTorch implementations

### Documentation

1. **API documentation:**
   - Add detailed docstrings to all classes and functions
   - Create examples of common workflows
   - Add parameter descriptions

2. **Usage guides:**
   - Create tutorial notebooks
   - Add example scripts with explanations
   - Provide configuration templates

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Memory optimization:**
   - Add gradient checkpointing for larger models
   - Implement more efficient implementations of core operations
   - Add flash attention support where applicable

2. **Training speed:**
   - Optimize data loading and preprocessing pipeline
   - Add more efficient distributed training support
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for common model combinations

3. **Inference optimization:**
   - Improve text generation speed
   - Add support for quantization (int8, bfloat16)
   - Optimize batch processing for evaluation

## Implementation Validation

To ensure the PyTorch implementation matches the JAX version:

1. **Run comparative benchmarks:**
   - Compare loss values on identical inputs
   - Verify alignment matrices are identical
   - Check token mapping results are consistent

2. **Model validation:**
   - Validate that distilled models perform similarly
   - Compare generated text quality
   - Ensure embeddings have similar properties

## Priority Order for Next Steps

1. Complete remaining tests for alignment algorithms
2. Create integration tests for the full pipeline
3. Add more comprehensive documentation
4. Implement performance optimizations

## Notes

The core implementation is now complete. All main scripts have been converted from JAX to PyTorch, including utility scripts that were previously missing. Further work should focus on testing, documentation, and optimization rather than implementing new features.
